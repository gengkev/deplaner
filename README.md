# deplaner
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/deplaner

I was in elementary school when writing this code, so please don't judge too hard.

Here's the project summary from the Google Code page:

---

**Deplaner is officially retired. If you would like an in-browser flight control game, 
see http://10k.aneventapart.com/Entry/Details/541**

Deplaner is a flight-control game being programmed that aims to be unique in its storyline and openness.
It is written in HTML5 technologies that will allow it to be played in all modern browsers, and soon mobile
browsers, with the first to be Android. Multi-touch will also eventually be implemented on Firefox 4 and
Android, with expansion to other platforms, as well as more "levels" for the game.
