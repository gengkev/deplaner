# deplaner
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/deplaner

I was in elementary school when writing this code, so please don't judge too hard.

In sixth grade, several friends and I wanted to create a game, so we formed a group. Not knowing anything
about creating games, I tried to use [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/). The game was supposed to be
like the game [Flight Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Control_(video_game)). We ended up
getting... something... but since none of us really knew what to do, we sort of failed. (In case it's not
obvious, the only directory with anything substantial is raphaelWebApp.)

The linked game was pretty cool. The link below is broken, but you can still visit
[the author's blog post](http://tech.tulinmola.com/2011/09/air-strike-for-aneventapart-10k-contest/)
or [the uploaded game itself](http://10k.aneventapart.com/2/Uploads/541/).

Here's the project summary from the Google Code page:

**Deplaner is officially retired. If you would like an in-browser flight control game, 
see http://10k.aneventapart.com/Entry/Details/541**

Deplaner is a flight-control game being programmed that aims to be unique in its storyline and openness.
It is written in HTML5 technologies that will allow it to be played in all modern browsers, and soon mobile
browsers, with the first to be Android. Multi-touch will also eventually be implemented on Firefox 4 and
Android, with expansion to other platforms, as well as more "levels" for the game.
